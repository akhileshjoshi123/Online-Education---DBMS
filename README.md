# Online-Education---DBMS
The online classroom is a teaching and learning environment located within a computer-mediated communication system. The objective of online classroom is to improve access to advanced educational experiences by allowing students and instructors to participate in remote learning communities using personal computers at home or at work; and to improve the quality and effectiveness of education by using the computer to support a collaborative learning process. Collaborative learning is a learning process that emphasizes group or cooperative efforts among faculty and students, active participation, and interaction on the part of both students and instructors, and new knowledge that emerges from an active dialog among those who are sharing ideas and information.
